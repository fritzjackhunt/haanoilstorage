            <h4>Haan Oil Storage</h4>

            <hr>

            <p>GSS Baltic Logistics oversees and operates independently owned tank farms in the Netherlands, distinguishing ourselves by our management expertise in facilities owned by major oil corporations in Houston and Rotterdam. Our management team meticulously handles all aspects of operations, including billing oil companies for storage and product handling services.</p>

            <p>Our tank farms, strategically located both above and below ground, are equipped with cutting-edge infrastructure to facilitate efficient discharges into heavy-duty oil tankers and pipelines.</p>

            <p>We pride ourselves on the presence of large-scale industrial facilities designed specifically for the secure storage of oil and petroleum products. These products are stored in our state-of-the-art tanks before being meticulously transported to end-users or transferred to further storage facilities. Our tank farms are strategically positioned to accommodate ocean liners unloading cargo, and some are seamlessly connected to pipelines, allowing us to draw supplies via rails, barges, and heavy-duty oil tankers. A key feature of our operations is the utilization of heavy-duty oil tankers directly from our grounds, ensuring swift transportation of products to petrol stations and other end-users. The products arriving at our tank farms are sourced directly from refineries, ensuring the utmost quality. Our modern tank farms feature a diverse array of tankage, pipelines, and gantries, all enhanced by a high degree of automation, revolutionizing depot operations to meet the most demanding industry standards.</p>
