            <h4>Tank Storage Facility</h4>

            <p>Haan Oil Storage oversees and operates independently owned tank farms in the Netherlands, distinguishing ourselves by our management expertise in facilities not owned by major oil corporations in Houston and Rotterdam. Our management team meticulously handles all aspects of operations, including billing oil companies for storage and product handling services. Our tank farms, strategically located both above and below ground, are equipped with cutting-edge infrastructure to facilitate efficient discharges into heavy-duty oil tankers and pipelines.</p>

            <p>We pride ourselves on the presence of large-scale industrial facilities designed specifically for the secure storage of oil and petroleum products. These products are stored in our state-of-the-art tanks before being meticulously transported to end-users or transferred to further storage facilities. Our tank farms are strategically positioned to accommodate ocean liners unloading cargo, and some are seamlessly connected to pipelines, allowing us to draw supplies via rails, barges, and heavy-duty oil tankers. A key feature of our operations is the utilization of heavy-duty oil tankers directly from our grounds, ensuring swift transportation of products to petrol stations and other end-users. The products arriving at our tank farms are sourced directly from refineries, ensuring the utmost quality. Our modern tank farms feature a diverse array of tankage, pipelines, and gantries, all enhanced by a high degree of automation, revolutionizing depot operations to meet the most demanding industry standards.</p>

            <p>This has led to the transportation of oil, gas, and petrochemicals over longer distances around the world. At the same time, markets and product flows have constantly changed, in response to more ambitious climate change policies, to geopolitical and economic fluctuations and to the development of new energy sources and cleaner fuels. The result is a growing demand for storage and handling of bulk liquids and gases at key locations along global marine trade routes.</p>

            <p>Determining the best locations for our terminals requires a long-term vision of global geo-economic developments, while constantly changing product flows demand flexibility and short-term action in the day-to-day work at the terminals. In such a dynamic context, our leadership depends on our ability to excel in three areas â€” the three pillars of our strategy.</p>

            <p>First, we aim to grow, maintain and adapt our global network of terminals to connect global products flows. Our experience and our market knowledge enable us to identify the right locations for our terminals to create long-term value. In light of the changing energy and petrochemical landscape and a continuing economic shift from West to East, Vopak our partner focuses on four categories of terminals. These are major hubs; gas terminals; terminals serving markets with structural deficits; and industrial and chemical terminals in the Americas, the Middle East, and Asia. These categories guide us in making an early selection of the most promising opportunities for growing our network, for expanding and improving existing locations and for identifying assets for divestment, thereby improving the risk-return profile of our global terminal portfolio. We call this Growth Leadership.</p>
